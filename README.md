The git repeository contains the both json file and lovable file and the links are available in the pdf.
The n8n json file or the link which i have provided the n8n account may have expired its free cloud time.

TO make it run safe the video is created IF someone is gonna run the above files make sure to change the webhook node in lovable 
try {
    const response = await fetch(
      "https://maheshjoicy.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/ai-recruiter",  (// make sure to change this link with the webhook which mail or local host ur using)
      {
        method: "POST",
        body: formData,
        // DO NOT set Content-Type header — browser sets it automatically with boundary
      }
    );
the above lines will be at 167 to 175
